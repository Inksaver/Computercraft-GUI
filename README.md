# Computercraft-GUI
An improved version of the Toolkit with mouse and/or keyboard control
Downloading tk3.lua and running it in a ccTweaked (Computercraft) Turtle will download the rest of the files in this repository, along with a number of utilities from the older Minecraft-Toolkit repository.

The Advanced Turtle allows clicking with the mouse on buttons and checkboxes. Clicking in a textbox sets it's focus for typing.

The standard Turtle does not have a mouse input, so keyboard instructions are given on the bottom line.

For example to select a checkbox, type it's index number displayed next to it and hit Enter. Repeat to change the state:

Use the 'b' key to emulate the 'Back' button, 'q' for 'Quit', 'n' for 'Next', 'c' to clear the keyboard input buffer
